## Quick Start Development

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/unidatum/MarketSystemsResearch.git
cd MarketSystemsResearch

# Start core services only
docker-compose up matching-engine settlement-engine

# Run performance tests
python tests/performance/test_matching_speed.py

# Monitor performance
watch -n 1 'docker stats'
```

### Performance Testing
```python
# tests/performance/test_matching_speed.py
import time
import asyncio
from src.exchange.matching_engine import OptimizedMatchingEngine

async def benchmark_matching_engine():
    engine = OptimizedMatchingEngine()

    # Warm up
    for _ in range(10000):
        engine.place_order(create_random_order())

    # Benchmark
    start = time.perf_counter_ns()
    for _ in range(1000000):
        engine.place_order(create_random_order())
    end = time.perf_counter_ns()

    elapsed_ms = (end - start) / 1_000_000
    orders_per_second = 1_000_000 / (elapsed_ms / 1000)

    print(f"Processed 1M orders in {elapsed_ms:.2f}ms")
    print(f"Throughput: {orders_per_second:,.0f} orders/second")
```

## Critical Success Factors

### What We're Building First
1. **Speed**: Fastest possible order matching
2. **Settlement**: Instant crypto transfers
3. **Custody**: Simple but functional wallet system
4. **Data**: Real-time market data feed
5. **API**: Basic trading interface

### What We're Deferring
1. **Complex Security**: Added after core is proven
2. **Full Compliance**: Basic KYC only initially
3. **Advanced Features**: No margin, derivatives initially
4. **Multiple Assets**: Focus on BTC and DEC only
5. **Enterprise Features**: No SSO, SAML initially

### Why This Approach Works
- **Prove the Core**: Validate that our trading engine is truly fast
- **Quick to Market**: Launch in 15 weeks vs 32 weeks
- **Iterative Security**: Add security without rebuilding
- **User Feedback**: Get real usage data early
- **Revenue Generation**: Start trading sooner
